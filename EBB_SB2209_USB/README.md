### Getting Started
To ensure the full functionality and stability of the product, when using the EBB SB2209 USB product, we recommend downloading and printing the STL files from this document for assembly. If you need further development of the printed parts, you can use the Step files provided in the CAD folder.

### Compatibility of Printed Parts
* **PCB_Spacer_EBB-SB-USB Printed Part:** This printed part is required for installing the EBB SB2209 USB product to be compatible with other original VORON Stealthburner printed parts. It is also compatible with the printed parts required for the installation of the EBB SB CAN product. Additionally, you can continue to use the original VORON Stealthburner PCB_Spacer without downloading this printed part, but we do not recommend this as it may slightly interfere with the optical coupler.
* **Main_Body_EBB-SB-USB and Cable_Cover_EBB-SB-USB Printed Parts:** Both of these printed parts must be used together for installing the EBB SB2209 USB product to be compatible with other original VORON Stealthburner printed parts. They are also required for the installation of the EBB SB CAN product. If used separately, there will be interference issues. Please download and use both printed parts together.
* **Cable_Cover_EBB-SB-USB Printed Part:** This printed part is required for installing the EBB SB2209 USB product. Using the original Cable_Cover on the VORON Stealthburner might result in incomplete closure.
